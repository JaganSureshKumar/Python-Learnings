Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
            
class car:
    def __init__(self,car_name,year):
        self.car_name=car_name
        self.year=year

    def printname(self):
        print('Car name',"|" ,'year of model')
        print(self.car_name,self.year)

student=car('Honda WRV','2018')
student.printname()
